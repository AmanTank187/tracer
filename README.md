# Tracer

Tracer is a clone of the famous track and trace app. I decided to work on this project because i am passionate about working on projects that have a positive impact. 
I am testing my learning and adding to my knowledge by using Ruby on Rails to create this app. 

---

## Focus

- Back-end: Consolidate learnings of Database associations, MVC, Well tested application.
- Front-end: Becoming more comfortable when creating views.
- Getting more comfortable and confident with rails. 
- Creating a project that i am passionate about and proud of. 
- Exploring gems i am interested in.

## Approach

- Ensuring the fundamentals are done correctly.
- Clean code.
- Using my trello board often. 
- Well tested code.
- Use branches more often.

## Learnings

- Comfortable with models and validations. 
- Creating controllers to suit my application. 
- Creating migration files to suit my application.
- Used devise for user sign up.
- Used the geocoder gem to get location. 
- Used Javascript to get coordinates of user.
- Becoming confident writing model and feature tests. 
- Using rails console. 


## Problems faced:

- Getting the Javascript values into the ruby form.
- Using rails console to identify i was writing a modal test incorrectly.

## Successes:

- Using the geocoder gem successfully. 
- Using the devise gem.
- Letting a user add their location.
- Good modal and feature tests.
- Confidently using rails application. 

## What i could have done better?:

- Followed Test driven development more strictly.
- Tidy up the modal code for location.

## What i could add to this project?:

- User has a test status.
- Constant DB check to see if anyone has tested positive.
- Send messages to you and other users notifying when someone has tested positive. 

## A better way to write existing code?: 

- Split the front end and back end.
  - Javascript on the front end and Rails on the backend.
  - Backend functions return json
  - Make API calls from the frontend with Javascript. 
- Using a Javascript library such as Vue. 
- Email confirmation using devise.
